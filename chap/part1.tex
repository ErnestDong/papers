\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Blockchain is more than ledger}
It's known that blockchain is a "distributed ledger".

However, blockchain is more than unchangeable storage.
Ethereum introduced smart contracts.
Ethereum is a distributed computer network.
Smart contracts are written by users and executed by miners.
Ethereum VM will execute the open-sourced code (so-called "smart contracts"), and then store the results on the blockchain,
This gave birth to DeFi \autocite{chen2020blockchain}, or Decentralized Finance.

Of course, the blockchain also has a wider application in the 3.0 era, which introduced DAO, a new form of corporation.

\subsection{Blockchain can be used in insurance}
Insurance service is also a financial product.
For now, DAOs such as Nexus and etherisc have designed and implemented some blockchain-based insurance,
such as crop insurance, flight delay insurance.
All you need is a metamask wallet with Ethereum for payment and claim.
The smart contract will offer the applicants a fair price.
The contract is explicit, as its code is open-sourced and can't be modified by anyone.
Once the insured event took place, claims are decided by incentive compatible voting of DAO.
